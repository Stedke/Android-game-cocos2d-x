# Android-game-cocos2d-x

Year: 10.2015

Game powered by cocos2d-x engine.
Written using C++ and Objective-C.

Simple game in which user tries to 'kill' all floating blocks with his gun,
before they reach left part of the screen. It was funny to write and test,
but I can't make it better due to the lack of time
(there are few options missing - top score view, different 'guns' and so on).
